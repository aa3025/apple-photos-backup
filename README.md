# apple-photos-backup
bash script for copying all your files from MacOS Photos Library

Pre-requisites: exiftool installed on your system https://exiftool.org/

The script assumes the standard location of your Photos Library on MacOS, though you can change it if necessary in backup_photos.sh script.

You need to specify the target directory for backup, see photos_backup.sh.
